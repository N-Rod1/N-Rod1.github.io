        <h1>About Half-Dome</h1>
        <p> Half Dome is a granite dome at the eastern end of Yosemite Valley in 
            Yosemite National Park, California. It is a well-known rock formation 
            in the park, named for its distinct shape. One side is a sheer face while 
            the other three sides are smooth and round, making it appear like a dome 
            cut in half.[3] The granite crest rises more than 4,737 ft (1,444 m) 
            above the valley floor.</p>
